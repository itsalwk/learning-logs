# Learning Logs — Personal Obsidian Vault

A **personal Obsidian vault** used as a digital commonplace book and learning journal.  
This vault helps me document mistakes, capture findings, distill insights, and organize topic-related notes — all in one place.

## 🎯 Purpose

This vault serves as a personal knowledge base to:
- Reflect on mistakes and understand their causes
- Document findings, observations, and key insights
- Summarize topics and concepts for future reference
- Continuously build and refine my learning habit  
- Leverage Obsidian’s tools for linking, tagging, and visualizing knowledge
